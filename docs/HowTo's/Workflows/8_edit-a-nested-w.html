<p>To test a nested workflow that's a draft, the parent workflow also needs to be in draft mode. If the state of the parent workflow is <strong>Published</strong>, the published version of the nested workflow will be run.</p><ol><li>Move the parent workflow to draft mode.</li><li>Edit the nested workflow.</li><li>Trigger either the parent or nested workflow manually.</li></ol><h2>View the list of dependent workflows</h2><p>When editing a workflow, avoid breaking changes by checking the list of dependent workflows and updating the ones that will be affected by the changes you're making. Get a list of the published workflows that are using the workflow you're viewing (parent workflows) by clicking the <strong>View Affected Workflows</strong> icon. Click any workflow on the list to open it in a new tab.<br>The affected workflows list includes only the direct parent workflows.
