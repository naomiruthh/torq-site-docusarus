<p>The Insights dashboard tracks how much time is saved with <span class="fr-deletable" data-variable="product-name" translate="no"></span> and monitors key workflow statistics. Set <span class="fr-deletable" data-variable="product-name-possessive" translate="no"></span> TimeBack benchmark for each published workflow and the total time saved across all workflows is calculated. The compiled metrics allow you to track different workflow analytics, quantify the results of your efforts, and monitor any runs that may require attention.&nbsp;</p><p><span class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-dvb fr-draggable" contenteditable="false" draggable="true"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IcqyST_Bh64?&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable" style="width: 500px; height: 300px;"></iframe></span><br></p><h2>What workflow metrics does the Insights dashboard display?</h2><p>The Insights dashboard compiles data based on your reported TimeBack benchmarks as well as executed runs and published workflows. You can see your most used workflows, your total published workflows, total runs, and individual workflow.</p><ul><li><strong>Breakdown</strong> displays the top five most time-saving workflows and shows the progression of their use.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/e159bc51-b5b1-4b1f-af39-a9db2fa968d6/Images/Documentation/t8cyqqimjhv6t7v6bhvyj9oglzfx5qfgyec6o5nvd05nogcceqtn6dzi5qx2nkoh.gif" alt="t8cyqqimjhv6t7v6bhvyj9oglzfx5qfgyec6o5nvd05nogcceqtn6dzi5qx2nkoh" class="fr-dib" style="width: 788px;"></p><ul><li><strong>Workflow runs</strong> displays the number of runs or the average run time using a daily breakdown.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/e159bc51-b5b1-4b1f-af39-a9db2fa968d6/Images/Documentation/5q6vrmh3otb2juibu6tyc6x9dvvu013ro7c95wvttrzd5aevecmjurbodmljlupp.png" alt="5q6vrmh3otb2juibu6tyc6x9dvvu013ro7c95wvttrzd5aevecmjurbodmljlupp" class="fr-dib" style="width: 738px;"></p><ul><li><strong>Most used workflows</strong> shows the most frequently used workflows.

Adjust the TimeBack benchmark to reflect the time the process would take to manually complete the use case by dragging the slider. To help you out, <span class="fr-deletable" data-variable="product-name" translate="no"></span> provides a default time that reflects the typical time it would take for that workflow.</p><section class="infoBox"><div class="title">üí°TimeBack TIP</div><div class="content">You can calculate the time the process would take by referencing past experiences or considering each step you have included - and the time wasted due to moving between applications and systems, human-in-the-loop, and fielding various subtasks that can pop up during a routine or irregular process.</div></section><h3>Dashboard review&nbsp;</h3><p>During your initial dashboard configuration, you can assign the TimeBack benchmarks from the <strong>Review</strong> button on the Insights dashboard. The workflows requiring a benchmark will be easily accessible.</p><h3><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/e159bc51-b5b1-4b1f-af39-a9db2fa968d6/Images/Documentation/e5cs3d9kcnycjvwuaz5a49yopfnpjz8wdqbb361l3nnib2kzt5gakr2o9shca9ls.gif" class="fr-dib" alt="e5cs3d9kcnycjvwuaz5a49yopfnpjz8wdqbb361l3nnib2kzt5gakr2o9shca9ls" style="width: 798px;"></h3><h3>Publish workflow</h3><p><meta charset="utf-8">When you publish a workflow you can update the default TimeBack benchmark or keep it as is.</p><h3><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/e159bc51-b5b1-4b1f-af39-a9db2fa968d6/Images/Documentation/cr6sgk5usn95umceda37x94qne7k5c3t1qcksmkeqlpg95eek1me8wkytqchhjsx.gif" alt="cr6sgk5usn95umceda37x94qne7k5c3t1qcksmkeqlpg95eek1me8wkytqchhjsx" class="fr-dib" style="width: 843px;"></h3><h3>Workflow manager</h3><p>You can change the TimeBack benchmark from within the main workflow viewer without having to enter each individual workflow by clicking on settings and adjusting the benchmark accordingly.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/e159bc51-b5b1-4b1f-af39-a9db2fa968d6/Images/Documentation/h2si81mvh9hy7mx12z93u1mm45wjd4duj88un8m65klk0hx8yx8u1hxu0bnpikua.gif" alt="h2si81mvh9hy7mx12z93u1mm45wjd4duj88un8m65klk0hx8yx8u1hxu0bnpikua" class="fr-dib" style="width: 835px;"></p><h2>What if I do not update the TimeBack benchmark?&nbsp;</h2><p>If the TimeBack benchmark is not adjusted before publishing, it will save the default time as that workflow's benchmark.</p><h2>What if I do not want the workflow included in the statistics?&nbsp;</h2><p>If the workflow does not save time or you do not want the run information included in the dashboard, you can check the box at the bottom of the TimeBack menu, and it will be excluded from the dashboard calculations.&nbsp;</p><section class="warningBox"><div class="title">üóíÔ∏è Note</div><div class="content">Dashboard adjustments are not retroactive.&nbsp;</div></section><p><br></p><h2><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/e159bc51-b5b1-4b1f-af39-a9db2fa968d6/Images/Documentation/2023-01-22_14-25-15.png" class="fr-dib" style="width: 471px;"></h2><h2>How do I filter the metrics on my dashboard?&nbsp;</h2><p>Select up to 5 tags from the tags dropdown menu (which is defaulted to All Tags) in order to display the metrics of the correspondingly tagged workflows.
