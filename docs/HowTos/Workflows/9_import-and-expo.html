<p>When you create a workflow on the designer, a YAML file is created with all the workflow information. To import and export workflows, you'll use this YAML file.</p><p><a href="/v1/docs/import-and-export-workflows#import-a-workflow" rel="nofollow" translate="no">Import</a> and <a href="/v1/docs/import-and-export-workflows#export-a-workflow" rel="nofollow" translate="no">export</a> enable you to share a workflow between accounts or to edit the workflow directly in the YAML file.</p><h2>Export a workflow</h2><p>There are two ways to export a workflow.</p><h3>Workflows page</h3><ol><li>Go to the <strong>Workflows</strong> page.</li><li>Click the menu icon for the workflow to export.</li><li>Click <strong>Export</strong>.</li></ol><p><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/e159bc51-b5b1-4b1f-af39-a9db2fa968d6/Images/Documentation/image-1671091675531.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-bordered" style="width: 1018px;"></p><h3>Designer</h3><ol><li>Open the workflow in the designer.</li><li>Click the menu icon at the top right part of the page.</li><li>Click <strong>Export</strong>.</li></ol><p><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/e159bc51-b5b1-4b1f-af39-a9db2fa968d6/Images/Documentation/image-1671091887819.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-bordered" style="width: 1021px;" alt="Export a workflow from the designer"></p><h2>Import a workflow</h2><p>To import a workflow, go to the <strong>Workflows</strong> page, click <strong>Import</strong>, and select the workflow YAML file.</p><p>When you import a workflow that includes nested workflows, Torq checks and does not duplicate the <a href="/v1/docs/create-a-nested-workflow" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no">nested workflows</a> that already exist in the account to which you're importing.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/e159bc51-b5b1-4b1f-af39-a9db2fa968d6/Images/Documentation/image-1671092244652.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-bordered" alt="Import a workflow" style="width: 1030px;"></p><p><br></p><h2>Handle failures</h2><p>Below are a few tips to help you deal with import and export failures. Keep in mind that imports and exports may also fail due to momentary issues.</p><h3>Workflow export</h3><p>An export failure might be an indication of a problem with the workflow you're trying to export. Try running the workflow by clicking <strong>Run Workflow</strong> or <strong>Test Run</strong> (depending on whether your workflow is published or <meta charset="utf-8"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Nunito, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: 0.48px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">in the draft state</span>) and fix any errors you encounter. When the workflow run completes successfully, retry the export.</p><h3>Workflow import</h3><p>An import failure might indicate that the YAML is not valid. If the workflow was exported, the YAML was valid. If the import is failing, most likely a manual change was made to the YAML file, which broke it. These are some common reasons a YAML might be broken.</p><ul><li>A nested workflow points back to one of its ancestors. For example, if <strong>Workflow&nbsp;</strong><strong>B&nbsp;</strong> is nested in <strong>Workflow A</strong>, then <strong>Workflow A</strong> can't be nested in <strong>Workflow&nbsp;</strong><strong>B</strong>.</li><li>The workflow YAML file points to a nested workflow that doesn't exist on the account to which you're importing.</li></ul><p>If no manual changes were intended, you can revert the YAML to a previous version that doesnâ€™t contain manual changes or, if possible, try exporting the workflow again.</p>
