<p>User roles can be used to implement an approval flow allowing certain users to create workflows but not affect production by publishing them.</p><p>Assign the <strong>Creator</strong> role to users who you want to be able to create and edit workflows but not publish them. When a Creator intends to publish a workflow, they have to submit it for review. The reviewers must have publishing privileges (<strong>Contributor</strong> or <strong>Owner&nbsp;</strong>roles) to publish the workflow after they review it. Contributors and owners also have the option to submit workflows for review to align with the organization's requirements.</p><h2>How to use</h2><ol><li>Create a workflow and test it.</li><li>When the workflow is ready to be published, click <strong>Submit For Review</strong>.<br><section class="infoBox"><div class="title">Note</div><div class="content">The current version of the workflow is submitted for review.
